**This web app is used for tracking the registered users' tickets **

It is an example of an issue tracker app which the computer testers/programmers uses to manage bugs/requests ticketing system.

**The purpose of this project is to learn: **

-Building a MVC Architectural Pattern, .NET Web App, Enhance C# .Net and to possibly add idea to upgrade issue tracker apps for ticket admins

**Most specifically, I used the following: **

-SQL Server Express
-Entity Framework
-CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
-Bootstrap UI 
-Authentication and Authorization using JQuery 
-Model, Controller, Views

**Website Look:**
Login Page:
Login as - username: 'admin'
           password: 'password'
